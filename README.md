# Stealthnote 
#### Probably the most minimal note app out there.

For when you need to quickly dump your ideas _**somewhere**_, and worry about structuring them later.

(Or, like, groceries. Whatever works for you)

## Features

- Jumbo-sized text input
- Dark mode / light mode based on device's settings
- Undo button
- Triple tap prepends a checkbox to the beginning of selected line (line of text separated by ‚èé)

## Installation

### Android

Android - Artifact / APK can be found here (for now): [build on expo.dev](https://expo.dev/accounts/unce/projects/stealthnote/builds/795a4bb0-c48d-47d2-963b-971c4f096cc0). Reach out if the link is broken.

There is no plan to get this app onto the app store for now.

### Local

You are welcome to play around with the app

_(assuming Android studio and all dependencies to run Expo are in place)_
1. Clone the repo
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn android`

### iOS?

No plans to have support on Apple devices. Unless someone finds the app valuable and they're on iOS. Then I might reconsider
